				Core Beliefs
			</div><br>
			As someone with very limited coding experience, I should probably not be giving the strictest advice on how/what to code. However, for my answers, I can give a "why" on certain opinions. So here goes.<br>
			<h3>Don't pay for what you don't have to</h3>
			I grew up on linux. I paid $0 for most software I use. A lot of the hardware I use I got for free. Someone's trash is someone else's treasure. Here I am on free (but dated) PC #3.
			<ul>
				<li>It's Operating System is free</li>
				<li>The text editors I use are free</li>
				<li>The compilers I use are free</li>
				<li>The tutorials and knowledge I use are free (or freely attainable)</li>
			</ul>
			Simply put, all the important stuff I use is free. And typically open-source. This is not to say that <b>everything</b> is free. Here are some things I paid for:


			<ul>
				<li>De Anza's CompSci classes ($>2k)</li>
				<li>Steam Library ($1100.23 as of 29/12/2019). Also, Approx 2k hours wasted </li>
				<li>GT1030 chip (I needed something not bad at half-height)</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Stretch your tech before your wallet</h3>
			Upon doing a quick "lshw", here are some quick headlines about my tech I'm using as of right now:

			<ul>
				<li>CPU:Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU G630T @ 2.30GHz (2012 trash, but free trash)</li>
				<li>GPU:NVidia GT1030 (I paid $75 a while back. Been through 3 computers)</li>
				<li>WLAN: slow</li>
				<li>RAM: 19GB (But it's low-clock DDR3)</li>
				<li>OS: Linux Lite</li>
				<li>HDD: 200GB (But it's low-clock DDR3)</li>

			</ul>

			So, excluding time, my setup cost $75. Is it good? Depends.<br>
			The network speed is bad, the CPU is dated (considered budget in 2012), the graphics card was low-end a couple years ago (bought new in winter of 2017). The Hard Drive is dated and "small". Nevertheless, I type this with no lag, developing fine enough.
			Because at the end of the day, C++ has been around longer than me. And thus, was around while processors were 2^(20/2) times slower than something bought today. That means that C++ compiling and running was 1024 times slower when I was born. And the movie "Hackers" is 4 years older than me. People were fine back then. Because everything was lighweight. And as weird as this sounds, <i>The Lightweight Software is accessible today</i>.<br>
			How do I get away with this dated tech? Simple:

			<ul>
				<li>Linux Lite (Fast)</li>
				<li>Coding/Scripting in notepad (As)</li>
				<li>Have enough RAM to avoid memory paging (Fricc)</li>
				<li>Not ask for too much*(Boi)</li>
			</ul>
			OK, so a couple of small things need either explaining or sacrificing. I gave up on games on this system. I am too lazy to install Steam, and the new games would be timely to run. But there is going to be another section on vide games soon.<br>
			I'm not using an actual IDE, as I have no idea which one to use. All of them have problems one way or another. In order of preference:
			<ol>
				<li>Notepad/equivalents (Doesn't help, but doesn't get in the way)</li>
				<li>Nano (Needs to remaster keyboard shortcuts. And no mouse support. And multiple file editing/referencing doesn't exist)</li>
				<li>Atom (Definitely not bad, but demanding)</li>
				<li>eMacs (Hard to use in my case until I grab the mouse. But that requires me either moving my arms or relearning key bindings)</li>
				<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (Live Free Or <b>Die <i>Hard</i></b>)</li>
			</ol>
			
			Observe how the top 4 are free. Observe how 3 of the editors are older than me. Which means that they are F A S T.<br>
			I see how lots of people think that Computer Science is a hobby that costs money. It doesn't have to. Because, here is an interesting bombshell:<br><b>Everything of value I have ever coded could be done on a Raspberry Pi</b>.<br>
			I'm Curious on how many lines of code I have ever written. It doesn't seem unreasonable that everything I have ever coded could fit on a floppy disk. I'll return to this later, but assuming 80 chars per line of code, and all code is in ASCII, a floppy disc stores 1.4*1024*1024/80 lines of code. Or 18350 lines of code. I approximate that that is close to the truth.

			<h3>You have a responsibility to future-proof and past-proof your own things</h3>
			Why is this important? Well, you don't want to accidentally make something that looks awkward. Especially when legacy code comes into play. Future-proof code helps avoid repeating previous code. Past-proofing code helps more people have access to your software. The CSS in this website works on 4-bit colour monitors (although I haven't tested it).

				Legitimate need for power
			</div><br>
			Sometimes, having modern hardware helps out a lot. There are ways to mitigate them, but for some people need it. I needed legitimate power at times. Typical examples are
			
			<ul>
				<li> Games <a href="https://xkcd.com/606/">(until you play older ones) </a></li>
				<li> Video Editing (Although kdenlive is fast enough in my lightweight laptop)</li>
				<li> 3D editing/animations (I have 160 hours of Blender on steam, I fully sympathise)</li>
				<li> Physics simulations (Universities have supercomputers for that. Completely understandable)</li>
				<li> Compiling big projects (never happened to me, likely to change soon)</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="miniTitle">Setups</div><br>
			<h3>Big Gaming PC</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>CPU : Intel I7-3770K</li>
				<li>GPU : NVIDIA GTX1070</li>
				<li>OS : Ubuntu 18.07</li>
				<li>RAM : 24GB of something or other</li>
				<li>Storage : 500GB HDD</li>
			</ul>
			Notes: It's in the middle of the living room, so playing games on it is awkward. But for power use, it's really good. Been through a lot with us, through GTX460, GTX650, 16GB RAM. 
			
			<h3>Smol Laptop</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>CPU : Intel m series something</li>
				<li>GPU : no</li>
				<li>OS : Ubuntu Studio</li>
				<li>RAM : 8GB of something or other</li>
				<li>Storage : 500GB HDD</li>
			</ul>
			Notes: Has it's problems, and dates back a while, to 2015. But it's so smol. I did APCS on it, so I think it's good enough for reasonable purposes. 


			<h3>Bedroom PC</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>CPU : Intel Pentium something something meh</li>
				<li>GPU : GT1030</li>
				<li>OS : Linux Lite</li>
				<li>RAM : 20GB of something or other</li>
				<li>Storage : <ul> 
					<li>200GB HDD</li>
					<li>500GB HDD backup</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			Notes: Has it's problems, namely of slow internet, and no games. It's perfectly fine once you give up on games. It's fine enough for git purposes. Also, it houses backups of questionable files. I love linux default disk encyption.

			<h3>NAS</h3>
			2TB RAID setup. Works fine.
