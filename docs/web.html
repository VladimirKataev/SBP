			I did a bit of javascript with canvas a long time ago. It was in 2015, and I have forgotten everything since. However I need a thing to show the important people, so here I go.

			The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
			The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds.
			Line up at the start.
			The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop.
			A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound "ding"
			Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible.
			The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
			The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.

			<div class="miniTitle">Explanation</div><br>
			When viewing source code, you could see that indentation in-source doesn't affect in-page indentation. <br>
			Neither does in-source newline-ing.<br>
			This helps in making source code look like code, maintaining readability. <br>
			Kinda weird. Got used to C++ needing specific formatting. This ignorance of tabs and spaces is weirding me out. I'm writing this with quarter-size windows, making text roll-on annoying. Using Leafypad as my text editor is kinda not helping.<br>
